Create a new PR from the current branch to the base branch: $ARGUMENTS

Instructions:
1. Get the current branch name and recent commits using git log to understand the changes
2. Extract the ticket number from the current branch name (e.g., PROJ-123, ABC-456, or similar patterns)
3. Analyze the commits to determine the appropriate conventional commit type:
   - feat: new feature or functionality
   - fix: bug fix
   - refactor: code refactoring without changing functionality
   - chore: maintenance tasks, dependencies, configs
   - docs: documentation changes
   - style: formatting, whitespace changes
   - test: adding or updating tests
   - perf: performance improvements
4. Create the PR with:
   - Title format: `<type>: [TICKET-123] brief description` (e.g., `feat: [ABC-123] add user authentication`)
   - Description: Summarize the changes in max 1000 characters. Do NOT include any "Generated by Claude" or similar attribution text
5. All changes are already committed - do NOT create any new commits or push changes
6. Use `gh pr create` with the --base flag set to the target branch provided in the arguments
